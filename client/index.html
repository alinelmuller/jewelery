             Then underneath that we do an embedded link. 
             There we just do <a href="Whatever our [homepage/landing page] will be URL"></a> -->

             The reason I put it into a div is in case we want to add a fancy image behind the text or just add some flare with opacity - Pedro -->

             Will handle a hover event listener. 
             Simple but SUPER effective way to have the user look at the items and maybe want to click it so it brings the product page.  
             Which is another event listener, but for now I can postpone the hover and do the click first. -->
